 PREFACE 

 Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3(TM) and Symphony(TM) perform user
 selected operations upon a data matrix that is termed a "worksheet". 

 Worksheet files are such matrices stored on disk. 

 A worksheet file is an unbroken sequence of binary coded records defining a
 single worksheet. 

 Both 1-2-3 and Symphony accept externally created data files if the files
 are in the worksheet file format.  Other programs can decode and process
 worksheet files created by 1-2-3 or Symphony. 

 The following document provides information required to create or access a
 worksheet file by describing the records used to create a worksheet file.
 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Lotus products and has ready
 access to 1-2-3 or Symphony documentation. 

 Note that the worksheet files for 1-2-3 and Symphony are similar, but not
 necessarily interchangeable.  1-2-3 and Symphony share some record types,
 but also have record types unique to that product.  Symphony can read 1-2-3
 records, but 1-2-3 cannot read Symphony records. 

 The information contained in this document has been released into the

 All efforts have been made to ensure that this information is clear and
 useful since Lotus will not be providing customer assistance with this
 booklet.  Lotus will, however, incorporate any necessary corrections if

 WORKSHEET FILE FORMAT 

 Worksheet files are organized as an unbroken sequence of variable length
 binary records.  Each record consists of a 4-byte header followed by the
 record body. The header defines the record's type and length, as the
 example below shows.
  
 The header's composition is as follows: 



 Byte Number               Byte Description 
 0,1                       Record type code 
 2,3                       Record body length (bytes) 


 Example: Record Header 

                               Record Header 

                           Record         Record 
                            Type          Length 

          Byte Number      0    1         2    3 
             Hex Code     1C   00        20   00 
   Decimal Equivalent       28             32 


 The record body can be of many different types; most have predetermined
 length, but some vary in length. 

 The record type code is 28. 

 In a hex dump of the file, the record type appears as 1C 00h, noting that
 the 8086/88 stores the most significant byte of word in the higher memory
 address. 

 The record length is 32 bytes. 
 In a hex dump of the file, the record length appears as 20 00h. 


 Record types with Column/Row Coordinates 

 Some record types contain column/row coordinates to identify a cell, or one
 of the two points that define a range.  Numbering starts at zero in the
 upper left corner of the worksheet. 
 For example: 

                             Cell A1 = column 0, row 0 





 SUMMARY OF RECORD TYPES 

 This section describes the different record types found in 1-2-3 and
 Symphony. 

 There are to Quick Reference tables ordered by Opcode and by Product,
 followed by a detailed reference section ordered by Opcode.  In the
 reference section, there are examples for the more commonly used records. 

 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with 1-2-3 or Symphony and has
 access to Lotus' documentation.
